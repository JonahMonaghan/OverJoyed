## Overview
OverJoyed is a software that allows people to convert their mouse into keyboard inputs. It's design affords it to be used for gaming, however, it can be used for any purpose. This software is currently still in development but due to time constraints we have chosen to release our alpha to collect user feedback until we can develop further. So please, bear with the messy code until we can take the time to clean things up.

Please contribute to our Github project or visit the ![releases page](https://github.com/JonahMonaghan/OverJoyed/releases) to try out the Overjoyed software! Thank you.
