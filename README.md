# OverJoyed
## Overview
OverJoyed is a software that allows people to convert their mouse into keyboard inputs. It's design affords it to be used for gaming, however, it can be used for any purpose. This software is currently still in development but due to time constraints we have chosen to release our beta to collect user feedback until we can develop further. So please, bear with the messy code until I can take the time to clean things up.
